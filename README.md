# QCD Package Brillouin 

## Dependencies
To build and use this project, you need the following dependencies installed:
- **OpenMPI** (`mpicc`)
- **C-lime** ([GitHub link](https://github.com/usqcd-software/c-lime))
- **GNU Autotools**
- **GSL** (GNU Scientific Library)

---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone QPB Locally
1. Clone this repository to a directory of your choice, e.g., `qpb_build/`.
   ```bash
   git clone <qpb-repository-link> qpb_build/
   ```
2. Navigate to a directory of your choice **other than and outside**
   `qpb_build/qpb/` (the root directory of the QPB project) for the next steps.

### Step 2: Install C-lime
1. Clone the C-lime repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/usqcd-software/c-lime.git
   cd c-lime
   ```
2. Build and install C-lime: 
* Run:
   ```bash
   ./autogen.sh
   ```
   * If successful, this command will generate additional files, including a
     `configure` script.
   ### Troubleshooting:
   * If you see an error like `autoreconf: command not found`, install GNU
     Autotools.
   * If you encounter `macro ... is obsolete`, run:
   ```bash
   autoupdate
   ```
   * Once the issue is resolved, rerun:
   ```bash
   ./autogen.sh
   ```
* Decide on an installation directory inside `qpb/`, e.g.,
  `qpb_build/qpb/install/`, and set the `LIMEPREFIX` variable.  
  **NOTE:** Avoid using `qpb_build/qpb/` as the installation directory to
  prevent conflicts and the risk of overwriting important files. Itâ€™s
  recommended to build in a separate directory from the source to maintain a
  clean and organized project structure.
   ```bash
   export LIMEPREFIX=<full-path-to-install-directory>
   ```
* Configure and build using the MPI compiler `mpicc` (do not use `gcc` to avoid
  compatibility issues with the `qpb` project):
   ```bash
   ./configure --prefix=$LIMEPREFIX CC=mpicc CFLAGS=-O3
   make
   make install
   ```

### Step 3: Configure QPB
1. Navigate to the QPB directory:
   ```bash
   cd qpb_build/qpb
   ```
2. Choose a `Makefile.in.<...>` file (e.g., `Makefile.in.CYCLONE`) and link it:
   ```bash
   ln -s Makefile.in.CYCLONE Makefile.in
   ```
   **Note:** Ensure `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` in this file point correspondingly
   to:
   * `qpb/install/include/`
   * `qpb/install/lib/`

### Step 4: Build QPB
1. Build the *library*:
   ```bash
   cd qpb/lib
   make
   ```
   #### Troubleshooting:
   If you see `fatal error: gsl/gsl_rng.h: No such file or directory`, install
   GSL.

2. Build *main programs*:
   ```bash
   cd qpb/mainprogs
   make
   ```

### Step 5: Running QPB Programs

1. Navigate to a `mainprogs` directory (e.g., `overlap-kl/ginsparg-wilson-relation`) and modify the `params.ini` file as needed. For more information on filling in the parameters file, consult the guide (N/A yet).  
   <!-- TODO: Guide for filling in the parameters files -->

2. Run the program with MPI (if supported). For example, using `mpirun`:
   ```bash
   mpirun -n 8 --bind-to core --report-bindings ./ginsparg-wilson-relation geom=2,2,2 params.ini
   ```
   Alternatively, you can use `srun`:
   ```bash
   srun -n 8 ./ginsparg-wilson-relation geom=2,2,2 params.ini
   ```
